## Preface

In the future, the keyboard has become an antiquated piece of technology that any cutting-edge devoloper worth his marbles would never place his fingers on. The trajectory is clear; all of us at some point have been writing Python code when a sudden thought befalls you: You could be so much more productive if you could just select the characters you wish to type using an Apple Scroll Wheel! Better yet, what if the scroll wheel simply generated digits of Pi that correspond to ASCII values? The application of such a powerful interface is clear. You probably are shaking your head wondering how in the world you never campe up with such a solution before. The future is now!

## How it works

1. Fetches Pi digits using A-Pi
2. User uses the innovative scroll wheel to select a triplet 
3. Run it in Python!

![Working demo](https://github.com/novelqq/mm2020rm/raw/master/usergif.gif)

Note: Although the gif did not record mouse movements, I can assure you that the tape movement was generated by rotating the wheel painstakingly slowly (on a trackpad)

## Try it out!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/novelqq/mm2020rm.git
cd mm2020rm/
npm install
src/patches/patch.sh # Fixes our python runner
npm start
npm run electron # in a new tab
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
